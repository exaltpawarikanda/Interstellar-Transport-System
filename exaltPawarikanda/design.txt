Considerations:

1.Used the Dijkstra shortest path algorithm as it gives the shortest path form start vertex to all other vertices.

2.Used the Graph and List data structures to implement it.

3.Chose a greed algorithm as it helps to get to the end more quickly.It makes locally optimum choices at each stage in the hope of finding a global optimum



Assumptions:
1.All edges have non-negative values.



Improvements:
1. Consider use of Belman-Ford algorithm to improve time complexity
2. Add more test cases
3. Include input validation
4. Include Security
